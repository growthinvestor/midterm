# Advanced Python Calculator (Midterm Project)
# Project Overview

This project is a Python-based advanced calculator developed for a Software Engineering graduate course midterm project. It focuses on arithmetic operations, history management using Pandas, plugin extensibility, and professional software development practices such as logging, exception handling, and testing.

# Key functionalities include:

Arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
Plugin system to add new operations (e.g., cube).
Command-line interface (REPL) for interactive user input.
History management with Pandas, storing calculation history in a CSV file.
Logging with customizable log levels and output to a file.
Continuous integration using GitHub Actions and comprehensive testing with Pytest.

# Key Components Explained
1. Core Calculator Functions (core.py)
This module implements the basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as the foundation for the calculator’s operations.


2. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) (repl.py)
This file implements an interactive command-line interface, where users can input operations and receive results. The REPL processes user commands and invokes the corresponding functions from the core module or plugins.

    Tested in test_repl.py to ensure it handles user input and manages commands properly.

3. History Management (history.py)
This module manages the calculation history using Pandas. It reads from and writes to history.csv located in the data/ folder. Users can review their calculation history, which is loaded automatically upon starting the application.

    test_history.py contains tests for saving and retrieving calculation history.

4. Plugins (plugins/)
The calculator supports a plugin system that allows users to extend its functionality with new operations. Example plugins like cube_plugin.py (calculates the cube of a number) and sqrt_plugin.py (calculates the square root) are included in the plugins/ folder.

    Plugins are tested in test_plugins.py to verify correct registration and operation.

5. Logging Configuration (logging.config.py)
The logging module is configured using environment variables stored in .env and the logging.conf file. The logging system captures application events, errors, and other runtime information, saving it to logs/app.log.

    All logs are written to the app.log file inside the logs/ directory.

6. Environment Variables (.env)
Environment variables are used for dynamic configuration, particularly for logging. The .env file contains configuration options such as log level and file destination.

1. Install Dependencies

    To install the required dependencies, ensure you're in the project root directory and run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create .env File
    Create a .env file in the root directory to configure logging:

3. Run the Application
    To run the calculator, activate the virtual environment (myenv) and start the REPL:

    source myenv/bin/activate
    python -m calculator.repl

4. Run Tests
    Run Pytest to execute all tests:

# Continuous Integration:

GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/python-app.yml) is used to automate the testing process. Each time code is pushed to the repository, the tests are executed automatically, ensuring continuous integration.

# Exception Handling:

The project employs both LBYL (Look Before You Leap) and EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) approaches:

LBYL is used in the REPL to check if user commands are valid before executing the operation.

EAFP is used in history management where the program attempts to read from the history file and handles errors if the file doesn’t exist.
